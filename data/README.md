Each reachable target +20 (google/openai/anthropic/grok — all equal weight)

## Strategy
- Parallel fetch from 6 sources
- Previous TOP 20 retested first every run
- Concurrent probe of all 4 targets per proxy
- Reachability = TCP+TLS handshake success (not 2xx)
- State persisted in data/.tested and data/.best_scores.txt (committed to repo)
